This is Word 2013 plugin (also support Word 2015), to use Wacom Signature SDK to capture signatures in Word.

## Usage

First, make sure a word document is opened, and the word cursor is at the position where you want the signature to appear. Click on the Capture button,  a signature pop up will appear to capture your signature from a Wacom device. After clicking the "OK" button, the signature will appear in the document where your cursor is located.
